# Lab 1 - Computer Graphics

## To run
python3 compiler.py. This might not work on Linux or Mac. Tried it out only on Windows 11.

## Structure
- `compiler.py` - The main file that runs the compiler for c++ including the libraries and dependencies
- dependencies - The folder that contains the dependencies for the compiler, mostly stuff related to OpenGL.
- src - The folder that contains the source code for the program. Here is divided into:
    - `main.cpp` - The main file that contains the main function and the code for the program.
    - gui/ - The folder that contains the code for the GUI.
    - vectors/ - The folder that contains the code for the vectors.
        - /manual - The folder that contains the code for the manual vectors. Manual refers to the vectors that are not generated by an external library like glm, here the vectors are generated by the a custom class.
        - /glm - The folder that contains the code for the vectors generated by glm library. Usually used by graphic libraries like OpenGL.

## Sucessful Output
When the program runs successfully, it should look like this:

## TODO
- [x] Edit compiler.py to make it work across all Operating Systems
